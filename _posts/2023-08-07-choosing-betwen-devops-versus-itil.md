DevOps and ITIL are two different approaches to managing IT services. DevOps is a philosophy that focuses on improving software deployment, while ITIL is a highly structured model built to boost productivity and offer statistics for IT teams. DevOps emphasises speed and delivering new features and updates as quickly as possible, while ITIL prioritises managing and improving existing services.

# DevOps killed the ITIL star?
While some people believe that DevOps is replacing ITIL or vice versa, the truth is that both approaches can work together. In fact, combining the two can lead to high productivity and improved workflow. To successfully combine DevOps and ITIL, it's important to establish a common framework for collaboration between teams.

When deciding which approach to use for Network Management, it's important to consider the problems you're having and the goals you want to reach. If your organisation values speed and agility in delivering new features, then DevOps may be the better choice. On the other hand, if your organisation values stability and reliability in managing existing services, then ITIL may be more appropriate.

# Benefits of DevOps
DevOps offers several benefits over ITIL, particularly in terms of speed and agility. DevOps emphasises collaboration between development and operations teams to improve software delivery speed and quality. By breaking down silos between teams, DevOps can help organisations achieve faster time-to-market for new products and features.

Another benefit of DevOps is that it brings cultural transformation, improving the speed and quality of how software is developed and delivered. This is achieved through automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and feedback loops. DevOps aims to create a culture of collaboration and experimentation, which can lead to greater innovation and creativity.

In contrast, ITIL focuses on process, standardisation, and metrics. While these are important aspects of IT service management, they can sometimes lead to a rigid approach that may not be well-suited for fast-paced environments. ITIL also tends to be more focused on control than on agility.

# What next?
In conclusion, there is no need to choose between DevOps and ITIL as they can complement each other. The decision of which approach to use depends on the specific needs of an organisation. Combining both approaches can lead to high productivity and improved workflow.
