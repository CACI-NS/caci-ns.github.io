NetDevOps and associated Network Automation are constantly evolving fields, and as such have what seems like a never ending amount of cool-named Tools, Frameworks and Libraries available for you to use to simplify your NetOps life. We've curated a few of our favourites, which we hope will help you in your journey towards NetDevOps. As always, [let us know](https://www.caci.co.uk/contact/#contact-form) what you think of these, or if we can [help you in your NetDevOps journey](https://www.caci.co.uk/contact/#contact-form).

## Best of 2023
Network Automation tools are essential for IT teams to execute complex tasks, including network configuration, security, and cost-efficient operations. Here's our pick of some of the most useful for 2023:

1. Terraform
2. netlab
3. Batfish
4. Cisco YANG Suite
5. Git

### Terraform
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is an Automation and Orchestration tool, capable of building Cloud, Network and IT Infrastructure based on input in HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language), which act as IaC (Infrastructure as Code) artifacts. Terraform is highly flexible and provides Modules and Providers for nearly every Network and Cloud vendor and technology going within the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io).

### netlab
[netlab](https://netsim-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Network Lab and Emulation tool, capable of taking IaC input definitions of a given Network Lab topology (such as YAML) and then having an emulated Lab of Network Device VM, Containers and Topologies to play with and perform learning or "What If?" scenarios upon.

### Batfish
[Batfish](https://www.batfish.org) is a Network Configuration Analysis tool that is highly useful in performing "Waht If?" scenarios, and providing rapid ability to pre and post-test Network Changes and ensure the desired state is achieved.

### Cisco YANG Suite
[Cisco YANG Suite](https://developer.cisco.com/yangsuite/) is a Learning and Development Suite, which provides a web-based User Interface to interact with an opinionated set of tools and plugins allowing you to learn, test, and adopt YANG Network Model programmable interfaces such as NETCONF, RESTCONF and gNMI others.

### Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com) is the de facto Version Control System, allowing for IaC, Network Configuration and Network Automation scripts and code to be stored in a consistent but distributed manner, and for collaboration on modifications of these to be shared between teams of Network and Automation Engineers without file blocking or version management issues.


## Worthy mentions
Although these didn't make our opinionated cut, these are certainly worth a mention and merit some investigation to see if they can benefit your situation at all:

- [Juniper Apstra](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/network-automation/apstra.html) - Intent Based Networking (IBN) Suite
- [Nornir](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Python Network Automation Framework
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - Automation and Orchestration Suite

## Wrapping up
Network automation tools are essential for IT teams to execute complex tasks, including network configuration, security, and cost-efficient operations. These are just some of the best Network Automation tools available in 2023. Other notable mentions include Chef, Saltstack, Jenkins and Python for Network Automation - but of course, choosing the right tool depends on your organisation's specific needs and requirements.
