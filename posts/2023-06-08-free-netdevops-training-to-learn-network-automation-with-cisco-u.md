Cisco have recently complemented their various Training and Learning Platforms (including [Cisco Digital Learning](https://digital-learning.cisco.com), [Cisco Learning Network](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/) and [Cisco Live](https://www.ciscolive.com)) with a new user-friendly offering - [Cisco U](https://u.cisco.com). While some of the content is pricy, we've found some completely free-of-charge Network Automation Courses that we think you should know about.

Unlike other Cisco training platforms, no special User Account is required - just use the same Cisco Connection Online (CCO) account you currently use as a NetEng today to login to the main [Cisco Portal](https://www.cisco.com) for activities such as [Cisco Certification Tracker](https://cp.certmetrics.com/cisco/en/login), [Cisco Software Downloads](https://support.cisco.com) and [Cisco TAC Case Manager](https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com).

## Pricing
[Cisco U](https://u.cisco.com) currently has three [Pricing Plans](https://u.cisco.com/subscription):

1. Cisco U Free - £0 per year
2. Cisco U Essentials - ~£1,200 per year (or 15 [Cisco Learning Credits](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/training/learning-credits.html))
3. Cisco U All Access - ~£3,800 per year (or 48 [Cisco Learning Credits](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/training/learning-credits.html))

Generally the difference between the subscription levels is around the specialism of content available, and for more interactive and live tutorial content, the higher subscription levels are required. As a summary of the differences:

| Subscription | Yearly Cost (GBP) | Yearly Cost (CLC) | Features |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Cisco U Free | £0 | 0 CLC | - Podcasts<br />- Webinars<br />- Videos<br />- Tutorials<br />- Skill Assessments<br />- Communities<br />- Network Automation Learning Path |
| Cisco U Essentials | ~£1,200<br />$1,500 | 15 CLC | As per Free tier, as well as:<br />- IT Training<br />- Some multi-vendor Training<br />- Soft Skills Training<br />- Associate-level Certification Learning Paths<br />- Some self-paced Online Labs |
| Cisco U All Access | ~£3,800<br />$4,800 | 48 CLC | As per Essentials tier, as well as:<br />- All multi-vendor Training<br />- Professional-level Certification Learning Paths<br />- In-depth Cisco Product Learning Paths<br />- In-depth Cisco Solution Learning Paths<br />- All self-paced Online Labs |

_Note: [Cisco Learning Credits](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/training/learning-credits.html) (CLC) are prepaid vouchers that you may already have an allowance of if you act as a Cisco VAR (Value Added Reseller) or have a large enough Cisco Contract_

## Amazing free stuff
Although some of those prices may seem a little steep for individuals, there is a great deal of **free** content available within the Network Automation realm, especially for those looking to learn about topics such as:

* Practices - NetDevOps, Pipelines, Pull Requests, Version Control, CI/CD
* Data Structures - YANG, YAML, JSON, XML
* Coding - Python, PIP, PyPI, Netmiko, pyATS, Genie, EXPRESSO, Bash
* Tooling - Ansible, Terraform, Cisco NSO, Vim, Linux, API

## The future of Cisco Learning
This looks like a promising step in consolidating all the disparate Cisco Learning platforms, systems and content into one centralised, easily-searchable, visually-appealing and well-organised place. Sure, the pricing may seem steep at present - and as an individual general Network Engineering Learner, you'd get better bang for your buck going via [CBT Nuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com), [INE](https://ine.com), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) - but for Network Automation-specific content, for **free**, [Cisco U](https://u.cisco.com), this is a surefire winner for anyone wanting to break in to the world of NetDevOps.
