    <p>Cisco IOS and Nokia SR Linux are two popular operating systems used in networking. While both have their strengths, they differ in several ways - SR Linux is chiefly a microservices-led, Containerised Network Operating System (NOS), whereas Cisco IOS is a monolithic NOS; with Cisco having made enhancements to their approach in the NOS under IOS-XR, IOS-XE and NX-OS.</p>

<h2>What's this SR Linux you speak of?</h2>

<p>One of the main differences between Cisco IOS and Nokia SR Linux is their architecture. Cisco IOS is a monolithic operating system, meaning that all features are integrated into a single image. This can make it difficult to upgrade or modify specific features without affecting the entire system. In contrast, Nokia SR Linux is a modular operating system, which allows for more flexibility in upgrading or modifying specific features without affecting the entire system.</p>

<p>Another difference between the two operating systems is their command-line interface (CLI). Cisco IOS uses a proprietary CLI that can be difficult to learn and use for those who are not familiar with it. On the other hand, Nokia SR Linux uses a standard Linux CLI that is more familiar to many users.</p>

<p>In terms of security, both operating systems have strong security features. However, Cisco IOS has been around longer and has had more time to develop its security features. Additionally, Cisco has a larger market share than Nokia in the networking industry, which makes it a bigger target for hackers.</p>

<p>Another difference between the two operating systems is their support and documentation. Cisco has an extensive support network and documentation library due to its large market share. In contrast, Nokia's support network and documentation library may not be as extensive due to its smaller market share.</p>

<h2>Containerlab.io and SR Linux</h2>

<p><a href="https://containerlab.dev">Containerlab</a> is an open-source tool that provides a CLI for orchestrating and managing container-based networking labs. It allows users to create virtual network topologies using Docker containers, making it easy to test and experiment with different network configurations.
One of the main benefits of Containerlab is its ease of use. It provides a simple command-line interface that allows users to quickly create and manage container-based networking labs. Users can specify the number of containers they want to create, the type of network topology they want to use, and other configuration options.</p>

<p>The open source Project is backed by Nokia SR Linux, and has a great deal of flexibility in supporting a wide range of containerised routers, including FRRouting, Quagga, Bird, Juniper and others. It provides the ability for Network Engineers to experiment with different routing protocols and configurations, as well as virtual wiring, VNETs, VXLAN and other topologies; as well as being easy to integrate with network Automation Tools such as Ansible and Terraform.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>Both Cisco IOS and Nokia SR Linux have their strengths and weaknesses, they differ in several ways such as architecture, CLI, security features, and support/documentation. Ultimately, choosing between the two will depend on individual needs and preferences.</p>
